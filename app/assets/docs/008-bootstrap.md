# Bootstrapping

## What is it?

For Sumcoin it means loading all of the block chain history from a special
file containing a snapshot of block data.

This special file, named `bootstrap.dat`, allows the Sumcoin client to
sync from your hard drive instead of the internet. Using a
`bootstrap.dat` file is faster and reduces stress on the Sumcoin network to sync new nodes.

## How do I make a `bootstrap.dat`?

Any synced client has the ability to make a `bootstrap.dat` file. Assuming
you're running linux you can do the following to manufacture your own.
First, shutdown your client. Allow it to cleanly exit so we know the block
data is settled.

Now, navigate to the directory `~/.sumcoin/blocks` in your terminal and
notice the files named `blk00000.dat`, `blk00001.dat`, `blk00002.dat`, etc.
These are the raw block data files that can be combined to form the
`bootstrap.dat`!

The command:
> cat blk*.dat > bootstrap.dat

will produce the `bootstrap.dat`.
The file is often then compressed (zip'ed, tar/gzip'ed) and shared.

The same process can be executed on Microsoft Windows (7+):

> CD C:\Users\<my_user>\AppData\Roaming\Sumcoin

> COPY /b blk0001.dat+blk0002.dat bootstrap.dat

Or on OS X:

> cd "~/Library/Application Support/Sumcoin/"

> cat blk*.dat > bootstrap.dat


On linux and OS X you can create hash of the bootstrap:

> sha256 bootstrap.dat

## How do I use a `bootstrap.dat`?

Assuming you're on linux and you haven't started the Sumcoin client before.

Make the directory `~/.sumcoin` if it doesn't exist and then move the
`bootstrap.dat` into the `~/.sumcoin` directory.

Start the Sumcoin client. You should see the status `Importing blocks from disk...` if the client has found the `bootstrap.dat` and is using it to
sync the block chain.
